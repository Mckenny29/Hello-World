# Hello-World
Trying to find my way around here. I am new to these stuff.
My name is Kehinde. I am currently taken courses on Python. I understand that GitHub is a very important platform to help achieve my goals.
It appears exciting so far and i hope i'm able to keep at it till i become proficient.
